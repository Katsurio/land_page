## Steps    
1) Initialized a new repo.

       (Hurdle Logs - 1.5) Updated MAMP and it broke all my virtual hosts. Spent time 
                           troubleshooting to no avail. Started over without Laravel. 
                      
2) Created project files with composer.
3) Added db connect files.
4) Added html,css,php, and includes (etc...) files.
5) Finished footer form.

       (Hurdle Logs - 5.5) Command Z'd for too long and deleted all the front end development progress I 
                           made in an un-initialized repo (I knew better, but so as they say, like death, 
                           stupidity is felt more by others). Called it a night after finding/saving all 
                           of my files from the terminal.
             
6) Removed text, and converted, extracted, and added PSD image assets to repo.

       (Hurdle Logs - 6.5) Apache server stopped working in MAMP this morning, grrr. Decided to restart
                           computer since nothing I googled worked to fix Apache. And, everything 
                           (i.e. vhosts, apache, I'm thinner, etc...) was automagically fixed from 
                           the restart!!!
7) Finished header.
