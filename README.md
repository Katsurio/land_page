## Steps  

   (Error Logs - 0.0) Updated MAMP and it broke all my virtual hosts. Spent time 
                      troubleshooting to no avail. Started over without using Laravel.   
1) Initialized a new repo
2) Created project files with composer
3) Added db connect files
4) Added php files/includes

   (Error Logs - 4.5) Command Z'd for too long and deleted all the front end development 
                      progress I made in an un-initialized repo (They say, like death, 
                      stupidity is felt more by others). Called it a night after finding/saving 
                      all of my files from the terminal.
             
5) Extracted and added PSD image assets

   (Error Logs - 5.5) Apache served stops working in MAMP this morning, grrr. Decide to restart
                      computer since nothing I google is working to fix Apache. Everything is 
                      automagically fixed (i.e. vhosts, apache, I'm thinner, etc...)!!!
