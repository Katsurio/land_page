## Steps    
1) Finished: initializing a new repo.

       (Hurdle Logs - 1.5) Updated MAMP and it broke all my virtual hosts and made 
                           it impossible to connect to the db/PHPMyAdmin. Spent time 
                           troubleshooting to no avail. Started over without Laravel. 
                      
2) Finished: creating project files with composer.
3) Finished: adding db connect files.
4) Finished: adding html, css, php, and includes (etc...) files.
5) Finished: footer_form's styling.

       (Hurdle Logs - 5.5) Command Z'd for too long and deleted all the front end development progress I 
                           made in an un-initialized repo (I knew better, but so as they say, like death, 
                           stupidity is felt more by others). Called it a night after finding/saving all 
                           of my files from the terminal.
             
6) Finished: removing text, and converting, extracting, and adding PSD image assets to repo.

       (Hurdle Logs - 6.5) Apache server stopped working in MAMP this morning, grrr. Decided to restart
                           computer since nothing I googled worked to fix Apache. And, everything 
                           (i.e. vhosts, apache, I'm thinner, etc...) was automagically fixed from 
                           the restart!!!

7) Finished: all main content styling.
8) Finished: media queries down to mobile.
9) Finished: AJAX call for sending form w/ jQuery to convertZipCode.php

       (Hurdle Logs - 9.5) I WAS using the slim build of jQuery, which had some things removed, ajax 
                           being one of them. Solving this gave me a brief moment of respite.

10) Finished: zip code conversion using googleto latitude/longitude coordinates.
11) Finished: add an OWASP validation library to sanitize form inputs.

Improvements I plan on making either this weekend or the following:
-Better visual cues for Ajax call/sql insert on success/error. 
-Refactor to utilize Laravel's built in form validation.
-I'm sure I'll think of more after I start up again, but I need sleep.
